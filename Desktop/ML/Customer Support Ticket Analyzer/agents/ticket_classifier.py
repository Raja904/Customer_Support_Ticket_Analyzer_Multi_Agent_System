        You will receive a ticket in the following format:

        Input format:

            "ticket_id": "12345",
            "customer_tier": "premium", # free/premium/enterprise

            "monthly_revenue": 5000,
            "account_age_days": 450
        }


        Your task is to classify the tickets and provide the output in the following format:

        Output format:
        {
            "issue_type": "bug"/"feature_request"/"security_issue"/"UI_problem"/"other",
            "severity_level": "low"/"medium"/"high"/"critical",
            "sentiment": "angry"/"neutral"/"polite",
            "priority_score": 0.95 (a value between 0 and 1, where values closer to 1 indicate higher priority)
        }

        Consider the following information when determining the output:
        1.  If the `customer_tier` is "premium" or "enterprise", these are important customers.
        2.  If the `subject` indicates a system error that requires urgent attention, assign a high `priority_score`.
        3.  If the `previous_tickets` value, `monthly_revenue`, and `account_age_days` value are high, it signifies an established customer who has raised an issue.
